# You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

# L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
# Reorder the list to be on the following form:

# L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
# You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

# SOLUTION BELOW

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def reorderList(self, head):
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        second = slow.next
        prev = slow.next = None

        while second:
            tmp = second.next
            second.next = prev
            prev = second

        first, second = head, prev

        while second:
            tmp1, tmp2 = first.next, second.next

#TAKEAWAYS:

# I got the general idea down, but got stuck when it came to finding the second half of the list. 
# To find the second half, use the slow/fast strategy, increment slow by 1 and fast by 2. 
# Second half will then start from slow.next. 

# From there its just simple list operations:

# Reverse the second half of the list, then merge.
