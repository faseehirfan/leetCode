# leetCode
Collection of my solved LeetCode questions

All files follow the following naming convention: `<QuestionNumber>_<QuestionName>.py` 

Where `QuestionName` is in the form `<Word1>-<Word2>-<Word3>-...-<WordN>`

For example: for LeetCode #1: TwoSum, the file would be `1_Two-Sum.py`

Key takeaways for questions that I got stuck on will be at the bottom of every solution.
